## Terminal
- Use a tiling terminal like [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Some useful commands
   - Recall your command history: `Up`
   - Change directories: `cd subdir/subsubdir`
   - Up one directory: `cd ..`
   - Auto-complete: `Tab`
   - Auto-complete, see all options: `Tab Tab`

## Gnome
- See all open windows `Super` (Super = Apple / Windows Key)
- Change Workspace: `Super + PgUp` or `Super + PgDn`
- Snap windows to sides (works just like in Windows)
- Snap windows to each other (you can do this. _It boggles my mind that Windows still doesn't let you do this_)
