{: .no_toc }

All tutorials assume you have followed the instuctions from [system startup](/tutorials/system_startup)

We will use the files located in "**_traj_setup/examples_**" and "**_trajectories/examples_**". When you pass the names of these files to ROS in the `roslaunch` command, you never need to use file extensions.


_Unless specified, all commands in these tutorials assume you want to run a command using BOTH the arm and a hand. If you want to run on only one device, some commands have optional arguments to enable this (noted throughout the tutorial)_
